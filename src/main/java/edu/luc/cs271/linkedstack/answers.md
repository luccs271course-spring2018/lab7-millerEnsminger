1.These methods are recursive emthods that are allowed to be called and defined
outside of the main method. This definition allows for them to repeatedly call
themselves until there is a break or a base case is met. This allows us to
get around using a less efficient while loop in another method or the main method.

2. These methods must have arguements since they are recursive methods that need an
input that updates each time the method is called until a break or a base
case is reached.

3. All of these methods are O(n) where n is the number of cases that must be 
addressed in order to finish the recursive calls through either the base
case or a break.

4. Any of the recursive methods methods can be written as while loops. These include
printReverse, populateFifoList, and populateList.
